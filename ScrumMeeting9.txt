SCRUM Meeting 9 for Omicron was held on May 1, 2023, and attendees included Max Hadley, Yash Dalal, Will Whatley, and Shicong Chu. The meeting began with the team going around and updating each other on what they did the previous day, what they planned to do that day, and any roadblocks they were facing. The next item on the agenda was a review of the sprint goal, which was to have a fully functional UI that integrates an AWS database with manager, server, and customer side functionality. The team discussed whether they had reached this goal and decided that they had. The team then discussed if there were any other changes that needed to be made before the final release. They also demoed the ordering UI and identified potential bugs that needed to be fixed. The status update since the last meeting included several accomplishments, such as the completion of the ordering UI, which will allow servers and customers to input orders and be recorded in order history.

Finally, the team reviewed the tasks completed since the last meeting, which included navigating to the cashier page, inputting customer orders, confirming and recording all customer orders, restarting the current order, inputting orders, placing orders, resizing the website to fit device screens, and removing underperforming items.
